# rhythmHeavenMini
Rhythm Heaven Mini is a scratch project that aims to recreate tickflow, but in a much easier way to read, write, and play.
It also supports custom games, and custom builds.

To add custom cues, that don't just broadcast the cue name in the minitickflow list, 
Step 1: Go to the listcontroller object.
Step 2: Go to the "define parse event" block
Step 3: Add "if (item (1) of (splitstroutput) = [cue name] then"
Step 4: Add the code you want it to run
Step 5 (Optional): For adding other things to the cue, add "if (item (2) of (splitstroutput) = [other] then" inside of it.

WARNING: If you try to run a remix with custom games, please make sure to have the build of the custom remix. If not, the game will spit out a NG screen.
(NG screen = a grey screen saying "No Game/Bad Build")


Happy Making!
